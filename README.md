Pacman Exercise

This is an exercise I did for my MIT MERN stack bootcamp. Pacman bounces around the screen. Click start game and then click a button to add more and more Pacmen!

How to Run:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio code.

2. Right click index.html

3. Select "Copy path"

4. Open browser and paste into URL

Roadmap of future improvements:

I would like it to start with a single pacman already bouncing across the screen as soon as the "start game" button is pressed so it is clear that the game has started. I would also like it to have a button to restart the game. Also, perhaps I could animate it so Pacman chomps his mouth and changes direction when he hits a wall.
